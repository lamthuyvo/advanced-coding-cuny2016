## Skills covered

All the Technology will be taught in the context of gathering, producing, editing and presenting compelling journalism:

#### Data reporting and analysis

* Data ethics 

* Extracting data from PDFs via Tabula

* Github for journalists — version control and collaboration

#### Story Presentation

*For static graphics *

* Adobe Illustrator 

* Ai2html

* Responsive web design, media queries and serving multiple screens** **

*For interactive graphics:*

* chosen.js or semantic-ui — ways to bring up data

* Javacript/JQuery — clean, object-oriented and reusable code; 

* parsing and customizing data

* Underscore.js — manipulating/sorting data

* D3 or Data-driven documents (a JavaScript library) — advanced data-visualizations 

## Assignments & Due Dates

All assignments will require a total of 250- to 500-words to accompany the interactives. Don't think 500 continuous words, rather words to help transition between various interactive elements. Some assignments and in-class exercises will be produced individually, others in agile teams:

1. Produce a news piece that involves charting of a narrative or trend using Illustrator. Think of it as a post for FiveThirtyEight, Vox.com, Quartz, The Upshot, the Wonkblog, the Fix or other short- to medium-form outlet. **Lesson 4, September 19 by Noon**

2. Build a data-driven news feature that is produced by using AI2HTML. **Lesson 7, October 14 by Noon**

3. Create a news app that allows people to understand a data set using a dropdown menu, searchable bar or other interactive component. The dropdown menu should change something in your app — text, a graphic, a table — to give new, personal insights t the data set. **Lesson 11, Nov. 16 by Noon.**

4. Produce a team project that explores a single timely and complex topic from different angles using the skills and story forms acquired during the semester. **Final due lesson 14, Dec. 6 by Noon.**

5. **Extra Credit: **Team to build and maintain publishing platform

## **Grading Rubric**

### **For all assignments**

In assessing students' work, the instructor will focus on the following factors applicable to all assignments (specific criteria for each assignment will be detailed later):

* Editorial quality: Has the work been prepared with careful thought and attention to detail? Were the drafts iterated and improved based on faculty feedback? (50%)

* Production value: Is it presented clearly and in a professional manner suitable for an audience? Is it executed with skill and subtlety, and has it been edited well and polished? (25%)

* Punctuality, completeness and attention to detail: Is it on time and complete, and does it fulfill the assignment? (25%)

### **For Discussions**

* Preparedness: Has the student completed the work necessary in preparation for the discussion (viewing assigned video, completing assigned reading or tutorial)? 

* Participation: Was the student engaged in the discussion (both paying attention and participating)?

### **For In-class Exercises**

* Effort: Did the student try to complete the exercise to better understand the lesson at hand?

* Participation: If the exercise involves collaboration, did the student contribute?

## **Assignment Values**

 

Grading for individual assignments is based on the level of professionalism of the finished work:

* A Student work that is approaching professional level, with minimal editing required.

* B Good quality student work. 

* C Unsatisfactory work.

* F Late, unacceptable work.

## Lesson-by-lesson

### **Class concept**

Students are introduced to the course, including what skills and topics are covered, the long term project and short term assignments, and some of the production logistics like server space, GitHub and where to publish.

We will be covering race and ethnicity with the following verticals:

1. Politics and policy

2. Economics 

3. Arts and culture

4. Education 

5. Immigration 

6. Science, Technology and Health 

During this class you will be assigned a beat which you cover throughout the semester and we will designate 2-3 web editors for extra credit. Once they have been given or chose a beat they will start putting together a quick beat memo: who are the main players in their beat, what are the 3-5 most prominent subjects within their beat and what are the best data sources for their beat.

Data, persuasion and truth: when it comes to disputed subjects people tend to stand by their beliefs rather than the facts because changing their mind means changing themselves. How can we tell stories about disputed subjects with truth and persuade those who much rather stand with their ideas instead of facts?
